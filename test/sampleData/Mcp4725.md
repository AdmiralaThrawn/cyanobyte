## Registers

### VOut
*12 bits*
*Writable*
VOut = (Vcc * value) / 4096
The output is a range between 0 and Vcc with
steps of Vcc/4096.
In a 3.3v system, each step is 800 microvolts.


### EEPROM
*12 bits*
*Readable**Writable*
If EEPROM is set, the saved voltage output will
be loaded from power-on.
